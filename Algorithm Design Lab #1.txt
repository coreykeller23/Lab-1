Step 4: Print out a line that lists one of my hobbies after a - symbol with 2 spaces before the - symbol

Step 5: Print out a line that lists one of my hobbies after a - symbol with 2 spaces before the - symbol

Step 6: Print out a line that lists one of my hobbies after a - symbol with 2 spaces before the - symbol

Step 7: Print a blank line

Step 8: print "     *******" to create the top of the I

Step 9: Print "       ***  " to start the middle of the I

Step 10: Print "       ***  " to continue the middle of the I
